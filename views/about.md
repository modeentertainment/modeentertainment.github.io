Founded in 2015 Mode helps event organisers by providing staff and performers from a trusted, extensive and growing database that has been built through 20 years in the events, marketing and performance industries.

Staff within the Mode network are experienced in working with a range of brands and clients including high end and high net worth (corporate and private). Many have chosen events staffing as a long term career as opposed to short term casual work, which brings with it a dedication to, and a pride in the roles they fulfil.

Mode prides itself on fantastic customer service and always strives to be the best its clients have ever worked with.
